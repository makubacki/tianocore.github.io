Welcome to TianoCore, the community supporting an open source implementation of [[UEFI]]. [[EDK II]] is a modern, feature-rich, cross-platform firmware development environment for the UEFI and [[PI]] specifications. We hope that you’ll delve into our work, use TianoCore for platform firmware, [[report any issues|Reporting Issues]] you find, and contribute to the community. Learn more on [[TianoCore Who we are]].

The latest [stable tag](https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/EDK-II#stable-tags) of EDK II is [edk2-stable202411](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/releases/tag/edk2-stable202411).

If you want to compile firmware or utilities, we recommend the [[Getting Started with EDK II]] page. This provides an overview of downloading [EDK II from github](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2) and building a sample platform ([[OVMF]], [[EmulatorPkg]], [[MdePkg]], ...). There are multiple [[hardware platforms|EDK II Platforms]] using EDK II open source UEFI firmware, including [[MinnowBoard Max/Turbot|MinnowBoardMax]], [[Aaeon UpSquared|IntelAtomProcessorE3900]], and [[Intel® Galileo Gen 2|Galileo]]. This allows you to experiment and develop UEFI features on real hardware.

TianoCore uses Bugzilla to track issues and feature requests. Please review [[Reporting Issues]] and [[Reporting Security Issues]] for more information. If you would like to contribute code or fix issues, please see [[How To Contribute]] along with our [[Inclusive Language Guidelines]]. The [[Tasks]] page has a list of priority work items.
