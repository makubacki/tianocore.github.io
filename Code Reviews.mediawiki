{{CommitProcess}}
Code reviews are a critical part of producing high quality code. This page documents how to use code reviews within our
projects, and how to be a code reviewer.

=Submit Code=
[[Code Contributions#Submitting Contributions|Submit your patch]] to GitHub as a pull request.

=Review Code=
As a member of the community, please take the time to review pull requests.

If you find issues, and think the code should be modified and re-reviewed before being used, leave comments in the
pull request to explain what you think needs to be changed.

If you think the code is reasonable for use, then approve the pull request.

If you think only minor modifications are required, then you can approve the pull request, but also leave feedback for
the minor changes you think are needed. The author will need to mark those feedback items as resolved before the pull
request can be completed.

Please consider [[Code Style]] issues as part of your code review.

=Resubmit Code=
If a review detects a major issue in your code, then make the changes and force push to your fork branch to update the
pull request.
