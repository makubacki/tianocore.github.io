# EDK II Continuous Integration

Summary of pre-commit and post-commit Continuous Integration services that
improve the quality of commits made to EDK II repositories.  The sections below
list the Continuous Integration services that are active and plans for future
enhancements and extensions to these services.

## Phase 1 (edk2 repository only) - Activated November 11, 2019

1) Use a combination of GitHub, Azure Pipelines, Mergify, and edk2-pytool features.
   * GitHub Pull Requests + Labels, Branch Protections,  Notifications
   * Mergify Pull Request Rules with auto commit if all checks pass
   * 3 pre-commit jobs in Azure Pipelines (PatchCheck, Windows/VS, Linux/GCC).
     Goal is to complete all pre-commits check in under 10 minutes.
   * 2 post-commit jobs in Azure Pipelines (Windows/VS, Linux/GCC).  Post commit
     status provided at top of `edk2/master` [Readme.md](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/Readme.md).
   * [EDK II Pytool Library](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-pytool-library)
   * [EDK II Pytool Extensions](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-pytool-extensions)
   * [TianoCore Bugzilla #2315](https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2315)
   * Original RFC Proposals
     - https://edk2.groups.io/g/rfc/message/93
     - https://edk2.groups.io/g/devel/message/46607
2) Enable the following pre-commit checks
   * [PatchCheck](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/e92b155740cdbf10a85ed8f37f69da0991fc8275/BaseTools/Scripts/PatchCheck.py)
   * [CharEncodingCheck](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/e92b155740cdbf10a85ed8f37f69da0991fc8275/.pytool/Plugin/CharEncodingCheck)
   * [CompilerPlugin](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/e92b155740cdbf10a85ed8f37f69da0991fc8275/.pytool/Plugin/CompilerPlugin)
   * [DependencyCheck](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/e92b155740cdbf10a85ed8f37f69da0991fc8275/.pytool/Plugin/DependencyCheck)
   * [DscCompleteCheck](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/e92b155740cdbf10a85ed8f37f69da0991fc8275/.pytool/Plugin/DscCompleteCheck)
   * [GuidCheck](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/e92b155740cdbf10a85ed8f37f69da0991fc8275/.pytool/Plugin/GuidCheck)
   * [LibraryClassCheck](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/e92b155740cdbf10a85ed8f37f69da0991fc8275/.pytool/Plugin/LibraryClassCheck)
   * [SpellCheck](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/e92b155740cdbf10a85ed8f37f69da0991fc8275/.pytool/Plugin/SpellCheck)
3) TianoCore EDK II Maintainers Team permissions reduced from 'Write" to "Triage"
4) EDK II Maintainers must use GitHub pull request with 'push' label to request
   a branch to be strict rebase merged into `edk2/master`.  If all checks pass,
   then the patches in the pull request are automatically added to `edk2/master`.
   If any check fails, then email notifications are sent and details of the
   failure are available through Azure Pipelines test results.
5) Personal builds available to all EDK II developers using a GitHub pull
   request without the 'push' label set.  If all checks pass, then a notification
   email is sent and the pull request is closed.  If any checks fails, then
   email notifications are sent and the details of the failure are available
   through Azure Pipelines test results.

* Verify modified modules/libs build
* Run available Host Based tests against modified modules/libs

# Post Commit Checks
* Build all modules/libs/platforms that consume modified content

* Verify that Doxygen Documentation can be generated

# Weekly Builds
* Build all packages
* Build all platforms
