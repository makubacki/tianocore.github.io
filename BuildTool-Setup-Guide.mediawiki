  Note: New build instructions are available. It is recommended to start with the new instructions if learning how to
        build edk2 for the first time. This page is retained for reference.

New instructions: [[Build-Instructions.md|Build Instructions]]

=='''GitHub EDK II Project Repositories'''==

* The EDK II BaseTools are part of the EDK II project repository.
* The EDK II project repository is available at https://github.com/tianocore/edk2.
* Prebuilt Windows tools are available at https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-BaseTools-win32.

= Getting the extra tools=
== Compiler ==
For both the BuildTools and [http://www.tianocore.org/edk2/ EDK II] projects, you will need to obtain a compiler from somewhere else. These instructions do not cover obtaining or installation of a compiler tools chain. The BaseTools build requires a C compiler; an assembler or ACPI assembler are not required to build tools in this project. BaseTools assume that a compiler is already configured in the environment.

== Python ==
The BaseTools build supports the Makefile based build for EDK II. All Tools are written in either C or Python. The C tools must compile on all operating systems with various compilers, so the code is written using simple, standard functions and libraries. The Python-based tools are written assuming the features that were available in Python. GUI applications can be created in Python, using the wxPython package and all Python applications can be converted to run under a native OS (Windows, Linux or OS/X.) via the [[Python Tools]].

The tools in this section are NOT required to build the EDK II project; they are needed to compile the
BaseTools used to build the EDK II project.

*Linux and OS/X developers using a command line, create a directory that will be used to hold the files, then change to that directory.
**Replace URL with apropriate one from [[Python Tools]]. Installation and configuration for these tools are left to the developer.
