  * The length of `Pkg-Module: Brief-single-line-summary` should be less than 72 characters.
  * Changes for CVE fixes need to append CVE number in `Brief-single-line-summary`. The format is
   `Pkg-Module: Brief-single-line-summary (CVE-Year-Number)`. Its length should be less than 92 characters.
* Blank lines should be an empty line with no whitespace.
