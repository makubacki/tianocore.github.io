# Patch Reviews

The patch series for review has been posted on the following branch using
7ed72121b7 as the base for the patch series.

  https://github.com/mdkinney/edk2/tree/Bug_1373_BsdPatentLicense_V3

The commits in patch series can be viewed here:

  https://github.com/mdkinney/edk2/commits/Bug_1373_BsdPatentLicense_V3

The patch series has one patch per package along with a few patches
to update the license information in the root of the edk2 repository
as described in the RFC V3.

Due to the size of the patch series, the preference is to not send the
patch emails.  Instead, please perform code reviews using content
from the branch.

All EDK II package maintainers and package reviewers should provide
review feedback for their packages.  The critical part of the review
is:
1) Any changes that cause build breaks or logic changes.  These code
   changes are intended to only modify license contents in comment
   blocks.
2) Any file that has been changed to BSD+Patent, but should remain
   with the current license.
3) Any file that that has not changed to BSD+Patent, but should be
   changed to BSD+Patent. 

Feedback and Reviewed-by emails should identify the patch the feedback
applies using the patch summary listed below.  The goal is to complete
all reviews to support the commit of these patches on April 9, 2019.

The following table provide a summary of the patches, the list of reviewers,
and the Reviewed-by status.

# RFC V3
 
 This RFC follows up on the proposal from Mark Doran to change the 
EDK II Project to a BSD+Patent License.

	https://lists.01.org/pipermail/edk2-devel/2019-February/036260.html

The review period for this license change is 30 days.  If there is no
unresolved feedback on April 9, 2019, then commits of the license change
patches will begin on April 9, 2019.  

  ** Please provide feedback on the proposal by Monday April 8, 2019. **

Feedback can be sent to edk2-devel at lists.01.org, the EDK II community
manager or any of the EDK II stewards.

  * Leif Lindholm   <leif.lindholm at linaro.org>    Steward
  * Andrew Fish     <afish at apple.com>             Steward
  * Laszlo Ersek    <lersek at redhat.com>           Steward
  * Michael Kinney  <michael.d.kinney at intel.com>  Steward

The goal is to convert all of the files in the edk2 repository that are
currently covered by the 2-Clause BSD License and the TianoCore
Contribution Agreement to a BSD+Patent License.  

I will be following up with pointers to public GitHub branches that
contain the set of changes to the edk2 repository for review.

The proposal is to perform this change to edk2/master in the steps listed
below. The license change will not be applied to any of the other existing
branches in the edk2 repository.

1) Add a License-History.txt file to the root of the edk2 repository that
   contains the 2-Clause BSD License and the TianoCore Contribution
   Agreement along with the details on the change to the BSD+Patent License.

2) Change License.txt in the root of the edk2 repository from a 2-Clause
   BSD License to the BSD+Patent License. The following is the link to the
   BSD+Patent License and the new License.txt file contents.

   ```

3) Change all files currently covered by a 2-Clause BSD License and the 
   TianoCore Contribution Agreement to a BSD+Patent License using the 
   following SPDX-License-Identifier statement:

       SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-2-Clause-Patent

   The use of SPDX-License-Identifier statement is based on the following:

        https://01.org/blogs/jc415/2018/open-source-hacks-one-question-interviews-open-source-experts-how-use-spdx-headers

4) Update Readme.md in the root of the edk2 repository to state that content
   is covered by a BSD+Patent License.  Also state that the BSD+Patent License
   is the preferred license for the EDK II project.

   a) Move the portions of Contributions.txt in the root of the edk2 repository
      Readme.md in the root of edk2 repository that describe how to contribute
      along with the commit message format.

   b) Add the following to Readme.md in the root of edk2 repository:

     ```
     # Developer Certificate of Origin

     Your change description should use the standard format for a
     commit message, and must include your `Signed-off-by` signature.

     In order to keep track of who did what, all patches contributed must
     include a statement that to the best of the contributor's knowledge
     they have the right to contribute it under the specified license.

     The test for this is as specified in the [Developer's Certificate of
     Origin (DCO) 1.1](https://developercertificate.org/). The contributor
     certifies compliance by adding a line saying

       Signed-off-by: Developer Name <developer@example.org>

     where `Developer Name` is the contributor's real name, and the email
     address is one the developer is reachable through at the time of
     contributing.

     Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

     By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

      (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
         have the right to submit it under the open source license
         indicated in the file; or

      (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
         of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
         license and I have the right under that license to submit that
         work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
         by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
         permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
         in the file; or

      (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
         person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
         it.

      (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
         are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
         personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
         maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
         this project or the open source license(s) involved.
     ```

5) Remove the Contributions.txt file from the root of the edk2 repository
   that contains the TianoCore Contribution Agreement.

6) Update all documentation to state that content submitted under the 
   BSD+Patent License no longer requires the Tianocore Contribution
   Agreement which means the following line is not required in commit
   messages for changes to files that are covered by a BSD+Patent License.

       Contributed-under: TianoCore Contribution Agreement 1.1

7) Create Wiki page(s) that provide the details of the BSD+Patent License
   change and provides the status of the license change for each TianoCore
   repository and package.

Once the conversion of the edk2 repository is complete, work will begin
on the other repositories in the TianoCore project.

# License-History.txt
 
 ```
                               License-History.txt
                              ===================

This file contains the history of license change and contributor's agreement
changes.

Unless otherwise noted in a specific file, the EDK2 project is now licensed
under the terms listed in the License.txt file.  Terms under which Contributions
made prior to the move to the License.txt formulation are shown below.  Those
terms require notice of the terms themselves be preserved and presented with the
contributions.  This file serves that preservation purpose as a matter of
documenting the history of the project.

Key Dates
----------
* August 3, 2017

  Update the TianoCore Contribution Agreement from Version 1.0
  to Version 1.1 to cover open source documentation associated

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ======================
    = Code Contributions =
    ======================

    To make a contribution to a TianoCore project, follow these steps.
    1. Create a change description in the format specified below to
       use in the source control commit log.
    2. Your commit message must include your "Signed-off-by" signature,
       and "Contributed-under" message.
    3. Your "Contributed-under" message explicitly states that the
       contribution is made under the terms of the specified
       contribution agreement.  Your "Contributed-under" message
       must include the name of contribution agreement and version.
       For example: Contributed-under: TianoCore Contribution Agreement 1.1
       The "TianoCore Contribution Agreement" is included below in
       this document.
    4. Submit your code to the TianoCore project using the process
       that the project documents on its web page.  If the process is
       not documented, then submit the code on development email list
       for the project.
    5. It is preferred that contributions are submitted using the same
       copyright license as the base project. When that is not possible,
       then contributions using the following licenses can be accepted:
       * BSD (2-clause): http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause
       * BSD (3-clause): http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause
       * MIT: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT
       * Python-2.0: http://opensource.org/licenses/Python-2.0
       * Zlib: http://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib

       For documentation:
       * FreeBSD Documentation License
         https://www.freebsd.org/copyright/freebsd-doc-license.html

       Contributions of code put into the public domain can also be
       accepted.

       Contributions using other licenses might be accepted, but further
       review will be required.

    =====================================================
    = Change Description / Commit Message / Patch Email =
    =====================================================

    Your change description should use the standard format for a
    commit message, and must include your "Signed-off-by" signature
    and the "Contributed-under" message.

    == Sample Change Description / Commit Message =

    === Start of sample patch email message ===

    From: Contributor Name <contributor@example.com>
    Subject: [Repository/Branch PATCH] Module: Brief-single-line-summary

    Full-commit-message

    Contributed-under: TianoCore Contribution Agreement 1.1
    Signed-off-by: Contributor Name <contributor@example.com>
    ---

    An extra message for the patch email which will not be considered part
    of the commit message can be added here.

    Patch content inline or attached

    === End of sample patch email message ===

    === Notes for sample patch email ===

    * The first line of commit message is taken from the email's subject
      line following [Repository/Branch PATCH]. The remaining portion of the
      commit message is the email's content until the '---' line.
    * git format-patch is one way to create this format

    === Definitions for sample patch email ===

    * "Repository" is the identifier of the repository the patch applies.
      This identifier should only be provided for repositories other than
      'edk2'. For example 'edk2-BuildSpecification' or 'staging'.
    * "Branch" is the identifier of the branch the patch applies. This
      identifier should only be provided for branches other than 'edk2/master'.
      For example 'edk2/UDK2015', 'edk2-BuildSpecification/release/1.27', or
      'staging/edk2-test'.
    * "Module" is a short identifier for the affected code or documentation. For
      example 'MdePkg', 'MdeModulePkg/UsbBusDxe', 'Introduction', or
      'EDK II INF File Format'.
    * "Brief-single-line-summary" is a short summary of the change.
    * The entire first line should be less than ~70 characters.
    * "Full-commit-message" a verbose multiple line comment describing
      the change.  Each line should be less than ~70 characters.
    * "Contributed-under" explicitly states that the contribution is
      made under the terms of the contribution agreement. This
      agreement is included below in this document.
    * "Signed-off-by" is the contributor's signature identifying them
      by their real/legal name and their email address.
