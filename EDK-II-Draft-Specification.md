was designed to support building packaging and distribution of EDK II modules,
as well as for building platforms and modules using the EDK II build infrastructure.
EDK II declaration files may be created during installation of a distribution that
follows the UEFI Platform Initialization Distribution Package Specification. They 
may also be created manually.  The EDK II Build Infrastructure supports generation
of UEFI 2.5 and PI 1.4 (Unified EFI, Inc.) compliant binary images.

are included as part of the EDK II compatibility package. In order to use EDK II Modules or the
EDK II Build Tools, an EDK II DSC and FDF file must be used. EDK II tools use INI style text based
files to describe components, platforms and firmware volumes. While similar to EDK DSC files, the
EDK II DSC file format is different, and new utilities have been provided to process these files.
The EDK II Build Infrastructure supports creation of binary images that comply with Unified EFI
(UEFI) 2.5 and UEFI Platform Infrastructure (PI) 1.4 specifications.
